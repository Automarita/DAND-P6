## Summary
This visualization is all about the air quality measures for **mainland China**.
Each frame reflects all cities' measurement(AQI/PM2.5/PM10/SO2/NO2)
in a certain hour's average on a certain date.
You can adjust the date, hour, and measure type in the uppper side.
Zoom in/out or drag the map for your free,
detail information will appears on the upper-right corner
when your mouse float a certain city.

## Design
d3.js is used for the map's visualization.
Map's geographical data comes from geojson files shared on the [Internet](http://www.ourd3js.com/map/china_mapdata/mapdata.zip).
Air quality measurement data comes from [PM25.in](pm25.in), 
and necessary reshape and refine works (**refine.sh, split.py**) have done for loading convenient.

Tools used for wrangling:

- sed (text filter)
- python pandas (split csv by hour)
- csvjson (csv to json by key)
- perl (text filter)
- jq (compress json)

After **refine.sh**,
each json file in `json/` is for each hour's record.
